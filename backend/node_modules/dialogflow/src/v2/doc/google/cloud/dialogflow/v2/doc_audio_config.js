 *   translations. See [Language
 *   Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/reference/language)

 *   voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should

 *   native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and
 *   0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any
 *   other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error.
 *
 * @property {number} pitch
 *   Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20
 *   semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the
 *   original pitch.
 *
 * @property {number} volumeGainDb
 *   Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the
 *   specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of
 *   0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)
 *   will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal
 *   amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the
 *   amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not
 *   to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for
 *   any value greater than that.

 * @property {string[]} effectsProfileId
 *   Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are
